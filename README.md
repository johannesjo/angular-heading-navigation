[Bug-reports or feature request](https://github.com/johannesjo/angular-heading-navigation/issues) as well as any other kind of **feedback is highly welcome!**

## getting started

Install it via bower
```
bower install angular-heading-navigation -S
```
and add `angularHeadingNavigation` as dependency in your main module:
```
angular.module('yourApp',[
  'angularHeadingNavigation'
]);
```

Using the component is easy. Just wrap your markup and your good to go:

```html
<div data-heading-navigation></div>
<h2 data-heading-navigation-heading>Some Heading</h2>
<h3 data-heading-navigation-heading>Some sub Heading</h3>
<h2 data-heading-navigation-heading>Some Heading</h2>
<h3 data-heading-navigation-heading>Some sub Heading</h3>
```
Your components should work as usual and they get a nice source-view attached. If you want to add a little more Information, you can use the description-tag. Everything inside, won't be shown in the source-view.

## configuration
There are also some defaults for you to set (if you like). You can do this by using the angularHeadingNavigation-provider:
```javascript
angular.module('exampleApp', [
  'angularHeadingNavigation'
])
.config(function (angularHeadingNavigationProvider)
{
 TBD
});
```
